# EEG Analysis
The scripts found in this repository are mainly used to preprocess and analyze EEG data collected at the Embodied Brain Lab. Before using these codes, are a few important dependencies that need to be installed on your machine.

## EEGLAB

You can either clone the [EEGLAB Github repo](https://github.com/sccn/eeglab) or download it from the following [wiki page](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php). Follow the download/installation instructions accordingly.

## Buzcode

We use many of the codes developed by the Buzsaki lab to analyze our EEG data. We recommend downloading and using the [development branch of the repository](https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/tree/dev). Download it, compile it with the supplied MATLAB script, and add it to your MATLAB path with all subfolders.

## AR Fit

Also used for analysis. Can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/tapios/arfit). Make sure you also add it to your path.
